## Data handling and processing

HuggingChat uses Hugging Faceâ€™s Inference Providers to access models from multiple partners via a single API. Depending on the model and availability, inference runs with the corresponding provider.

- Security & Compliance: <https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/security>

Security and routing facts

- Hugging Face does not store any user data for training purposes.
- Hugging Face does not store the request body or the response when routing requests through Hugging Face.
- Logs are kept for debugging purposes for up to 30 days, but no user data or tokens are stored in those logs.
- Inference Provider routing uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit.
- The Hugging Face Hub (which Inference Providers is a feature of) is SOC 2 Type 2 certified. See <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security>.

External providers are responsible for their own security and data handling. Please consult each providerâ€™s respective security and privacy policies via the Inference Providers documentation linked above.

## Technical details

The app is completely open source, and further development takes place on the [huggingface/chat-ui](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui) GitHub repo. We're always open to contributions!

You can find the production configuration for HuggingChat [here](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui/blob/main/chart/env/prod.yaml).

HuggingChat connects to the OpenAIâ€‘compatible Inference Providers router at `https://router.huggingface.co/v1` to access models across multiple providers. Provider selection may be automatic or fixed depending on the model configuration.

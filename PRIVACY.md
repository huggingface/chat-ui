## About available LLMs

The goal of this app is to showcase that it is now possible to build an open source alternative to ChatGPT. ðŸ’ª

We aim to always provide a diverse set of state of the art open LLMs, hence we rotate the available models over time.

Historically, HuggingChat has been running models such as:

- [Llama 2 70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf)
- [CodeLlama 35B](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/)
- [Falcon 180B](https://www.tii.ae/news/technology-innovation-institute-introduces-worlds-most-powerful-open-llm-falcon-180b)
- [Mistral 7B](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/)
- [Cohere Command R+](https://huggingface.co/chat/models/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus)
- [Google Gemma 7B](https://huggingface.co/chat/models/google/gemma-1.1-7b-it)

This is only a partial list. Check the [models](https://huggingface.co/chat/models/) page for up-to-date list of the best available LLMs.

## Technical details

This app is running in a [Space](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview), which entails that the code for this UI is publicly visible [inside the Space repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/tree/main).

**Further development takes place on the [huggingface/chat-ui GitHub repo](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui).**

The inference backend is running the optimized [text-generation-inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) on HuggingFace's Inference API infrastructure.

It is therefore possible to deploy a copy of this app to a Space and customize it (swap model, add some UI elements, or store user messages according to your own Terms and conditions). You can also 1-click deploy your own instance using the [Chat UI Spaces Docker template](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=huggingchat/chat-ui-template).

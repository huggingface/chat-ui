/**
 * Normalize a persisted update uuid into a provider-safe tool_call_id.
 * Mistral-family chat templates require exactly nine alphanumeric characters,
 * a shape every other provider also accepts; the persisted uuid is only a
 * correlation key, so the id just has to pair calls with results consistently.
 *
 * The live loop and history replay both derive the id from the same uuid, so a
 * round is sent with the same bytes when it is replayed on a later turn and the
 * provider's prompt cache still covers it.
